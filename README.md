# E-Commerce-return-rate-reduction

# Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world e-commerce behavior using the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset to understand why customers cancel/return orders, identify high-risk product categories, and build a machine learning model to predict return probability.
The goal is to help e-commerce businesses reduce operational losses, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize seller/product performance.
