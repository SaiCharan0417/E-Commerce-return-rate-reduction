# E-Commerce-return-rate-reduction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world e-commerce behavior using the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset to understand why customers cancel/return orders, identify high-risk product categories, and build a machine learning model to predict return probability.
